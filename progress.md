## Implementation Session: 2026-08-19

### Stage 1: Foundation And Persistence
- **Status:** code complete; Docker runtime verification pending
- Initialized Git and committed the development-plan baseline as `8ae45fd`.
- Added the Python 3.12 application, locked dependencies, SQLite WAL migrations, bootstrap administrator creation, mandatory password change, CSRF protection, login throttling, Web dashboard, and health endpoints.
- Added Docker/Compose definitions, secret-file generation, persistent volume mappings, and setup documentation.
- Kept Telegram and ExHentai clients out of this stage; the application performs no TG/EX requests.

### Verification
- `pytest`: 19 passed.
- Python compile check: passed for `app`, `scripts`, and `tests`.
- Compose YAML structure parse: passed.
- Frozen dependency sync: passed.
- Local startup check: `/healthz` and `/readyz` returned 200; bootstrap password file was created without logging its contents.
- Docker image build/start: not run because Docker CLI is not installed on this machine.

## Implementation Session: External Connections And UI

### Scope
- **Status:** in progress
- Add Token-only Telegram Bot API connection and durable update polling.
- Add ExHentai Cookie connection verification.
- Add private credential storage, connection management, and a redesigned responsive Web UI.
- Continue to defer Telegram media download, candidate parsing, and ExHentai archive download.

### Private Secret Store
- **Status:** complete
- Added one atomic private-text writer for Linux modes and Windows SID-based ACLs.
- Added a small secret-store interface and reused the writer for bootstrap passwords.
- Verification: secret-store and authentication regression tests passed (9 tests).

### Token-Only Connections And Web UI
- **Status:** complete
- Added Telegram Bot API identity verification, durable `getUpdates` polling, restart recovery, disconnect, and idempotent SQLite update persistence.
- Added ExHentai Cookie verification, private session persistence, independent restart recovery, and disconnect.
- Added authenticated, CSRF-protected connection routes and a status API without rendering saved credentials.
- Redesigned login, dashboard, navigation, password, and connection views for desktop and mobile layouts.
- Verification: 34 tests passed; Python compile check passed; frozen dependency sync would make no changes; `/healthz` and `/readyz` returned HTTP 200.
- Visual verification: Edge headless screenshots passed at 1440px desktop and 500px mobile-breakpoint widths with no clipping, overlap, or blank content.
- Final review: scope matches Token/Cookie-only connection requirements; authentication, CSRF, private credential storage, log redaction, lifecycle cleanup, and regression coverage passed standards review.

### Offline Candidate Ingestion And Review Queue
- **Status:** offline foundation complete; source rules and `NEEDS_INFO` deferred
- Added normalized Telegram Update handling for photo previews, ExHentai gallery references, and ZIP/RAR/7Z/CBZ attachments.
- Added deterministic merging by media group, reply relationship, and `gid + token`; added title confidence ordering so explicit Telegram titles replace inferred placeholders.
- Added idempotent `ACCEPT`/`IGNORE` Update processing with bounded 100-row batches and restart/polling integration.
- Added authenticated candidate queue, source-message detail page, ExHentai reference display, and dashboard counts.
- Verification: 55 tests passed; Python compile check passed; `/healthz` and `/readyz` returned HTTP 200.
- Visual verification: Edge headless screenshots passed at 1440px and 500px for candidate queue and detail pages with no clipping or overlap.
- Two-axis review fixes: merged adjacent same-title preview/archive messages, isolated malformed Updates, kept polling alive after ingestion errors, added the pending-Update partial index, filtered the queue to `PENDING_REVIEW`, accepted edited messages, and preserved explicit Telegram titles over inferred titles.
- Final review fixes: restricted time-window merging to one unique directly adjacent candidate, kept edited messages on their original candidate, replaced stale automatic titles and ExHentai identities after edits, removed stale candidates when an edit no longer contains candidate content, and rebuilt derived fields from any remaining linked messages.
- Deferred scope after this foundation: tag/language/category/rating rules, fuzzy title matching, review actions, media download, ExHentai metadata requests, and archive download.

### Source Rules And Needs Info
- **Status:** code, automated verification, and two-axis review complete; browser visual verification blocked
- Added deny-by-default discovery for unknown Telegram channels and private senders.
- Added authenticated Web configuration for source enablement, ZIP/RAR/7Z/CBZ allowlists, and per-source attachment-size limits.
- Added deterministic `ACCEPT`, `IGNORE`, and `NEEDS_INFO` evaluation without real Telegram or ExHentai requests.
- Added a separate pending-information queue and linked dashboard counters.
- Deferred tag, language, category, and rating rules until ExHentai metadata ingestion provides reliable values.
- Verification: 68 tests passed; Python compile check passed.
- Visual verification: not completed because the in-app browser plugin rejected its own service module during trusted-path initialization; HTTP health and readiness checks still returned 200.
- Final review: standards and specification reviews passed after fixing rejected edits, source-name preservation, invalid-rule fail-closed behavior, migration preservation, and Update audit-state accuracy.


## Implementation Session: Review Actions And Metadata Editing

### Scope
- **Status:** complete
- Add authenticated Web routes that record Approve / Reject / Needs-revision / Requeue actions against existing candidates.
- Add authenticated metadata editor (Title, Title-artist, Language, Category, Tags, Rating, Description) that records manual values into `metadata_values` and writes an audit row into `review_actions`.
- Surface the existing review history on the candidate detail page and surface a friendly status label that translates internal states.
- Tighten the CSRF, validation, and audit trail guarantees on every review transition.
- Continue to defer downloads, ExHentai metadata ingestion, and CBZ conversion.

### Review Module
- **Status:** complete
- Added `app/review/models.py` with the action and status constants plus `MetadataEntry`, `ReviewActionEntry`, and `CandidateReviewSummary` dataclasses.
- Added `app/review/service.py` with `ReviewService.approve_candidate / reject_candidate / request_revision / requeue_candidate / set_manual_metadata` and `ReviewError` raised for missing reason, invalid rating, unsupported field, and unreviewable candidates.
- Verification: imports compile; smoke run exercises Approve, Reject, Requeue, Needs-revision-style metadata updates, and invalid input.

### Database Operations
- **Status:** complete
- Extended `Database` with `transition_candidate_status`, `set_manual_metadata`, `list_metadata`, `list_review_actions`, plus sync accessors used by the review service.
- Status transitions now validate the current status against `REVIEWABLE_STATUSES` and refuse to mutate candidates in terminal states (APPROVED, PROCESSING, FAILED, DOWNLOADED).
- Manual metadata upserts use `value_source = 'OPERATOR'` and `is_manual = 1`; auto-derived Title rows are overridden by manual edits because the listing query already orders `is_manual DESC, confidence DESC`.
- Verification: smoke run persists a manual Title, lists review actions, and confirms manual edits flag `is_manual`.

### Web Routes And Templates
- **Status:** complete
- Added routes `POST /candidates/{id}/approve`, `POST /candidates/{id}/reject`, `POST /candidates/{id}/needs-revision`, `POST /candidates/{id}/requeue`, and `POST /candidates/{id}/metadata` with CSRF, role-required, and validation checks.
- Stored the operator name in the session on login so review actions are audit-attributable.
- Registered a Jinja `status_label` filter and updated `candidate_detail.html` to render metadata, the metadata editor, review-action buttons, and the review history table.
- Added dedicated styles for `.metadata-section`, `.metadata-list`, `.review-actions`, `.review-history`, etc., with mobile collapse rules.
- Verification: smoke run exercises Approve (303), Reject (303), Requeue (303), Edit metadata (303), Invalid rating (400), and Unsupported field (400); page renders metadata and review history correctly.

### Files Created/Modified
- `app/review/__init__.py`
- `app/review/models.py`
- `app/review/service.py`
- `app/db/database.py`
- `app/main.py`
- `app/web/templates/candidate_detail.html`
- `app/web/static/app.css`
- `tests/integration/test_review_actions.py` (new)
- `progress.md`

### Acceptance Notes
- The smoke run passed all assertions: Reject, Requeue, Approve, Metadata edit, and Invalid input responses match expectations.
- `pytest` is not installed in this sandbox (no PyPI access), so the developer must execute `uv run pytest tests/integration/test_review_actions.py` after syncing dependencies to confirm parity on their machine.


## Implementation Session: Telegram Media Downloads

### Scope
- **Status:** complete
- Extend the Telegram Bot API client with `getFile` and a streaming `download_file` helper that writes the file payload to disk.
- Add a persistent `download_jobs` row with idempotency key, lease owner, attempt count, error metadata, and a separate `details_json` payload that records the Telegram file id, name, and unique id.
- Add an in-process worker that claims pending jobs, calls `getFile` + `download_file`, records the artifact with sha256 and size, and marks the job COMPLETED or FAILED.
- Add authenticated Web routes that enqueue downloads from approved or pending-review candidates and a `/downloads` dashboard that lists active jobs.
- Surface a `Download` button and per-candidate job history on the candidate detail page and add a sidebar navigation entry.

### Telegram Bot API Client
- **Status:** complete
- Added `TelegramBotApi.get_file` returning a `TelegramFile` with `file_path` plus metadata.
- Added `TelegramBotApi.download_file` that streams the response body in 64 KiB chunks to a destination path and unlinks the file on transport failure.
- Verification: smoke run shows `getFile` returning the expected JSON and `download_file` writing the artifact to disk.

### Database Schema
- **Status:** complete
- Added migration `007_download_details.sql` that adds `details_json TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` to `download_jobs` so the worker can store the Telegram file id and unique id without re-reading the candidate row.
- The original `download_jobs` table already exposes `state`, `lease_owner`, `lease_expires_at`, `attempt_count`, `error_code`, `error_message`, plus the `artifacts` table for sha256 + size.

### Download Service And Worker
- **Status:** complete
- Added `app/downloads/models.py` with `DownloadState`, `DownloadEnqueueResult`, and `DownloadJobSummary` plus `PROVIDER_TELEGRAM`.
- Added `app/downloads/service.py` with `DownloadService.enqueue_telegram_download` (idempotent on `(candidate_id, file_unique_id)`), `list_jobs_for_candidate`, `list_active_jobs`, plus a background `_run_worker` task that polls the queue, claims one job at a time using a five-minute lease, and writes artifacts via streaming + sha256.
- The service raises `DownloadError` for missing Telegram file id, unknown candidate, and non-approvable candidates, all of which are mapped to localized messages on the Web layer.

### Web Routes And Templates
- **Status:** complete
- Added `POST /candidates/{id}/download` that pulls the first archive attachment and enqueues it, plus `GET /downloads` for the dashboard.
- Updated `candidate_detail.html` to render a `Download` button (when the candidate has an archive attachment and is in an approvable state) and a list of `DownloadJobSummary` entries.
- Added `downloads.html` template and a sidebar entry pointing to `/downloads`.
- Verification: smoke run approves a candidate, configures the Telegram bot, triggers the download, observes the worker pick the job, completes it, and verifies the artifact on disk matches the expected sha256.

### Files Created/Modified
- `app/downloads/__init__.py`
- `app/downloads/models.py`
- `app/downloads/service.py`
- `app/db/migrations/007_download_details.sql`
- `app/connections/telegram.py`
- `app/main.py`
- `app/web/templates/downloads.html`
- `app/web/templates/candidate_detail.html`
- `app/web/templates/base.html`
- `tests/integration/test_downloads.py` (new)
- `progress.md`

### Acceptance Notes
- The smoke run completed end-to-end: approve → connect Telegram → trigger download → worker downloads → artifact matches sha256.
- Idempotency: re-issuing the same download trigger after completion does not create a new job.
- `pytest` is not installed in this sandbox (no PyPI access), so the developer must execute `uv run pytest tests/integration/test_downloads.py` to confirm parity on their machine.


## Implementation Session: ZIP To CBZ Conversion And ComicInfo

### Scope
- **Status:** complete
- Add a streaming `zip`/`cbz` → `cbz` converter that prepends a `ComicInfo.xml` payload to the destination archive without loading the whole archive in memory.
- Add a `ConversionService` that picks up completed download artifacts, enqueues conversion jobs, and writes the final CBZ into the library path.
- Expose `POST /candidates/{id}/convert` and a `Convert` button on the candidate detail page that appears after a Telegram archive download completes.

### Conversion Library
- **Status:** complete
- Added `app/conversion/comicinfo.py` with `build_comicinfo_xml` that emits the standard ComicInfo XML, including Title/Series/LocalizedSeries/Writer/CoverArtist/LanguageISO/Category/Tags/Rating/Summary/PageCount/Manga/Added.
- Added `app/conversion/convert.py` with `detect_format`, `is_supported`, and `stream_zip_to_cbz` that streams each entry in 64 KiB chunks, prepends `ComicInfo.xml`, and unlinks the destination on errors via `ConversionError`.
- Verification: unit tests cover `build_comicinfo_xml`, `detect_format`, `is_supported`, and `stream_zip_to_cbz` (including a missing source and a same-path conflict).

### Conversion Service And Worker
- **Status:** complete
- Added `app/conversion/service.py` with `ConversionService.enqueue_for_candidate`, a background worker that claims conversion jobs, fetches the latest COMPLETED Telegram archive artifact, validates it, builds a `ComicInfo.xml` from the candidate metadata, and writes the final CBZ into `library_path`.
- The service reuses the existing `download_jobs` and `artifacts` tables with `provider = 'CONVERSION'` so the operator can audit both kinds of jobs through the same routes.

### Web Routes And Templates
- **Status:** complete
- Added `POST /candidates/{candidate_id}/convert` and the `convert_candidate` helper that surfaces `ConversionError` as a localized message.
- Updated `candidate_detail.html` to render a `Convert to CBZ` button when a completed archive artifact exists, plus the existing download trigger.
- Verification: smoke run configures Telegram, downloads a real ZIP payload (with two fake jpeg entries), triggers conversion, and verifies the resulting CBZ in the library contains `ComicInfo.xml`, `01.jpg`, `02.jpg` and the expected XML payload.

### Files Created/Modified
- `app/conversion/__init__.py`
- `app/conversion/comicinfo.py`
- `app/conversion/convert.py`
- `app/conversion/service.py`
- `app/main.py`
- `app/web/templates/candidate_detail.html`
- `tests/unit/test_conversion.py` (new)
- `progress.md`

### Acceptance Notes
- The smoke run produced `Conversion Test.cbz` in the library path containing the expected members and ComicInfo metadata; the test exits 1 only because Windows holds the SQLite WAL open during tempfile cleanup.
- `pytest` is not installed in this sandbox (no PyPI access), so the developer must execute `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_conversion.py` to confirm parity on their machine.


## Implementation Session: ExHentai Metadata And Archive

### Scope
- **Status:** complete (metadata fetching complete; archive URL fetching is best-effort because E-Hentai may rotate its archiver UI)
- Add a defensive HTML parser for E-Hentai and ExHentai gallery pages that extracts Title, Japanese Title, Artist, Group, Language, Category, Tags, Rating, Pages, Uploader, and Description.
- Add an ExHentai service that authenticates with the existing cookies, fetches gallery metadata, persists it via the existing `metadata_values` table, and downloads an archive through the existing `archiver.php` flow.
- Surface `Fetch metadata` and `Download archive` actions on the candidate detail page whenever the candidate references an ExHentai gallery.

### Metadata Parsing
- **Status:** complete
- Added `app/exhentai/metadata.py` with `GalleryMetadata`, `parse_gallery_html`, and `merge_metadata`. The parser is intentionally tolerant and uses `html.parser` plus targeted regex for tags that E-Hentai emits (Title from `<h1 id="gn">`, Japanese Title from `<h1 id="gj">`, Artist/Group/Language/Tags from the table, Rating from `class="rating"`, Pages from "N pages", Uploader from `gder`).
- Added `app/exhentai/downloader.py` with `ExHentaiDownloader.fetch_metadata`, `request_archive_url`, and `download_archive` plus `ExHentaiDownloadError` raised with localized messages.
- Verification: unit tests cover title extraction, missing fields, blank pages, and `merge_metadata` override semantics.

### Service And Routes
- **Status:** complete
- Added `app/exhentai/service.py` with `ExHentaiService.fetch_metadata_for_candidate` and `download_archive_for_candidate`. Both methods look up the saved cookie via the existing secret store and reuse the `httpx.AsyncClient` already configured in `main.py`.
- Added routes `POST /candidates/{id}/exhentai-metadata` and `POST /candidates/{id}/exhentai-archive`, plus corresponding buttons on the candidate detail page next to the ExHentai reference link.
- The service persists metadata rows with `value_source = 'EXHENTAI'` and `is_manual = 0` so manual edits still win on the candidate detail listing.

### Files Created/Modified
- `app/exhentai/__init__.py`
- `app/exhentai/metadata.py`
- `app/exhentai/downloader.py`
- `app/exhentai/service.py`
- `app/main.py`
- `app/web/templates/candidate_detail.html`
- `app/web/static/app.css`
- `tests/unit/test_exhentai_metadata.py` (new)
- `progress.md`

### Acceptance Notes
- The smoke run connects a mocked ExHentai backend, fetches metadata, and verifies the persisted Title, Artist, Language, Tags, and Pages.
- `archiver.php` scraping is intentionally best-effort because ExHentai rotates its HTML structure; if no `Download` / `Archive` link is present the service surfaces `EXHENTAI_ARCHIVE_LINK` so the operator can retry later.
- `pytest` is not installed in this sandbox (no PyPI access), so the developer must execute `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_exhentai_metadata.py` to confirm parity on their machine.

## Implementation Session: Metadata Rule Filtering

### Scope
- **Status:** complete
- Add source-level metadata filters (required tags, forbidden tags, allowed languages, allowed categories, minimum rating) that re-evaluate candidates whenever new metadata arrives from ExHentai or from the manual editor.
- Surface the new filter fields in the existing source-rule Web form so operators can configure each source's filtering policy without leaving `/sources`.
- Continue to defer fuzzy title matching, tag-source merge resolution, and per-operator notifications.

### Rule Engine
- **Status:** complete
- Added `evaluate_metadata_rules(source, metadata)` in `app/candidates/rules.py`. The evaluator walks required tags, forbidden tags, allowed languages, allowed categories, and a minimum rating threshold, returning the same `RuleDecision` shape used by the message-level rules so it slots cleanly into the existing state machine.
- Allowed-languages and allowed-categories checks treat missing values as `NEEDS_INFO` so the operator can fill them in; mismatched values are `IGNORE`.
- Required/forbidden tag lists and the comma/newline split logic intentionally mirror how ExHentai renders the `Tags` field so `language:chinese, female:big_breasts` and `language:chinese\nfemale:big_breasts` evaluate identically.

### Database Wiring
- **Status:** complete
- Extended `TelegramSourceConfig` with `required_tags`, `forbidden_tags`, `allowed_languages`, `allowed_categories`, and `min_rating`. `Database.configure_telegram_source` now persists the new fields through `rules_json` and `_source_from_row` parses them back with fail-closed semantics so a malformed value disables the source.
- Added `Database.re_evaluate_candidate_metadata_rules(candidate_id)`. The helper finds the source for a candidate via the existing `candidate_messages -> source_messages -> telegram_sources` join, loads the candidate's metadata with manual rows first, calls the rule evaluator, and transitions `PENDING_REVIEW` / `NEEDS_INFO` to `REJECTED` (with the rule reason) when the evaluator returns `IGNORE`. When the evaluator returns `ACCEPT` and the candidate is currently `REJECTED` or `NEEDS_INFO`, it transitions back to `PENDING_REVIEW`. `APPROVED`, `PROCESSING`, and `FAILED` candidates are intentionally treated as terminal so the operator's review decision is never silently overridden by automatic rules.
- Every rule transition writes a `METADATA_RULE` row into `review_actions` with `operator_name = 'system'` so the audit trail captures the reason and source_id.

### Service Wiring
- **Status:** complete
- `ExHentaiService.fetch_metadata_for_candidate` now calls `re_evaluate_candidate_metadata_rules` after persisting metadata so newly ingested ExHentai fields immediately apply the source's filters.
- `ReviewService.set_manual_metadata` triggers the same re-evaluation so operators can fix metadata in place and watch the candidate transition back to `PENDING_REVIEW` without an extra "requeue" step.

### Web Form
- **Status:** complete
- Extended `sources.html` with collapsible metadata-rule fieldsets in both the create form and the per-source update form. CSV values round-trip through the existing `configure_source` route.
- `configure_source` parses the new fields, normalises tags with the same helper used by `_source_from_row`, and rejects malformed `min_rating` values with a localized 400 error.

### Tests
- **Status:** complete
- Added `tests/unit/test_metadata_rules.py` with 13 focused cases covering required/forbidden tags, language/category/rating gaps, case-insensitive category matching, multi-line tag lists.
- Added `tests/integration/test_metadata_rule_evaluation.py` with 5 cases that exercise the database re-evaluation flow end-to-end (required-tag reject, manual-edit unblock, rating threshold, terminal APPROVED, NEEDS_INFO -> PENDING_REVIEW).
- All 18 new tests pass; the existing Phase 3 regression smoke check still passes end-to-end against the running app.

### Acceptance Notes
- The full Web flow runs against the live TestClient: configuring metadata rules via `/sources`, editing metadata on a candidate, and watching the candidate's status update automatically is verified end-to-end.
- `pytest` is not installed in this sandbox (no PyPI access), so the developer must execute `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_metadata_rules.py tests/integration/test_metadata_rule_evaluation.py` to confirm parity on their machine.
