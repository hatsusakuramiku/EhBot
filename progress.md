## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 3 complete |
| Where am I going? | Awaiting user review before implementation |
| What's the goal? | Produce an implementation-ready EhBot development plan |
| What have I learned? | See `findings.md` |
| What have I done? | Created and verified `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` |

## Implementation Session: 2026-08-19

### Stage 1: Foundation And Persistence
- **Status:** code complete; Docker runtime verification pending
- Initialized Git and committed the development-plan baseline as `8ae45fd`.
- Added the Python 3.12 application, locked dependencies, SQLite WAL migrations, bootstrap administrator creation, mandatory password change, CSRF protection, login throttling, Web dashboard, and health endpoints.
- Added Docker/Compose definitions, secret-file generation, persistent volume mappings, and setup documentation.
- Kept Telegram and ExHentai clients out of this stage; the application performs no TG/EX requests.

### Verification
- `pytest`: 19 passed.
- Python compile check: passed for `app`, `scripts`, and `tests`.
- Compose YAML structure parse: passed.
- Frozen dependency sync: passed.
- Local startup check: `/healthz` and `/readyz` returned 200; bootstrap password file was created without logging its contents.
- Docker image build/start: not run because Docker CLI is not installed on this machine.

## Implementation Session: External Connections And UI

### Scope
- **Status:** in progress
- Add Token-only Telegram Bot API connection and durable update polling.
- Add ExHentai Cookie connection verification.
- Add private credential storage, connection management, and a redesigned responsive Web UI.
- Continue to defer Telegram media download, candidate parsing, and ExHentai archive download.

### Private Secret Store
- **Status:** complete
- Added one atomic private-text writer for Linux modes and Windows SID-based ACLs.
- Added a small secret-store interface and reused the writer for bootstrap passwords.
- Verification: secret-store and authentication regression tests passed (9 tests).

### Token-Only Connections And Web UI
- **Status:** complete
- Added Telegram Bot API identity verification, durable `getUpdates` polling, restart recovery, disconnect, and idempotent SQLite update persistence.
- Added ExHentai Cookie verification, private session persistence, independent restart recovery, and disconnect.
- Added authenticated, CSRF-protected connection routes and a status API without rendering saved credentials.
- Redesigned login, dashboard, navigation, password, and connection views for desktop and mobile layouts.
- Verification: 34 tests passed; Python compile check passed; frozen dependency sync would make no changes; `/healthz` and `/readyz` returned HTTP 200.
- Visual verification: Edge headless screenshots passed at 1440px desktop and 500px mobile-breakpoint widths with no clipping, overlap, or blank content.
- Final review: scope matches Token/Cookie-only connection requirements; authentication, CSRF, private credential storage, log redaction, lifecycle cleanup, and regression coverage passed standards review.

### Offline Candidate Ingestion And Review Queue
- **Status:** offline foundation complete; source rules and `NEEDS_INFO` deferred
- Added normalized Telegram Update handling for photo previews, ExHentai gallery references, and ZIP/RAR/7Z/CBZ attachments.
- Added deterministic merging by media group, reply relationship, and `gid + token`; added title confidence ordering so explicit Telegram titles replace inferred placeholders.
- Added idempotent `ACCEPT`/`IGNORE` Update processing with bounded 100-row batches and restart/polling integration.
- Added authenticated candidate queue, source-message detail page, ExHentai reference display, and dashboard counts.
- Verification: 55 tests passed; Python compile check passed; `/healthz` and `/readyz` returned HTTP 200.
- Visual verification: Edge headless screenshots passed at 1440px and 500px for candidate queue and detail pages with no clipping or overlap.
- Two-axis review fixes: merged adjacent same-title preview/archive messages, isolated malformed Updates, kept polling alive after ingestion errors, added the pending-Update partial index, filtered the queue to `PENDING_REVIEW`, accepted edited messages, and preserved explicit Telegram titles over inferred titles.
- Final review fixes: restricted time-window merging to one unique directly adjacent candidate, kept edited messages on their original candidate, replaced stale automatic titles and ExHentai identities after edits, removed stale candidates when an edit no longer contains candidate content, and rebuilt derived fields from any remaining linked messages.
- Deferred scope after this foundation: tag/language/category/rating rules, fuzzy title matching, review actions, media download, ExHentai metadata requests, and archive download.

### Source Rules And Needs Info
- **Status:** code, automated verification, and two-axis review complete; browser visual verification blocked
- Added deny-by-default discovery for unknown Telegram channels and private senders.
- Added authenticated Web configuration for source enablement, ZIP/RAR/7Z/CBZ allowlists, and per-source attachment-size limits.
- Added deterministic `ACCEPT`, `IGNORE`, and `NEEDS_INFO` evaluation without real Telegram or ExHentai requests.
- Added a separate pending-information queue and linked dashboard counters.
- Deferred tag, language, category, and rating rules until ExHentai metadata ingestion provides reliable values.
- Verification: 68 tests passed; Python compile check passed.
- Visual verification: not completed because the in-app browser plugin rejected its own service module during trusted-path initialization; HTTP health and readiness checks still returned 200.
- Final review: standards and specification reviews passed after fixing rejected edits, source-name preservation, invalid-rule fail-closed behavior, migration preservation, and Update audit-state accuracy.
